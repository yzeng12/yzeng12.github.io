						<h1>Background and Ambitions</h1>
						<!--<h2>my world begin </h2>-->
						<br/>
						
						<p class="styleText" >My name is Yixin Zeng. I was born in Shanghai, China on March 4, 1995. I came into IIT with no experience in computer science. I only know some basic computer knowledge and basic VB language as I learned in High School.
						
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p class="styleText">When I started at IIT, I didn't know whether or not I would be able to grasp the concepts of coding and computer science. I progress very slowly at CS100 class when professor ask me build a dynamic website with user login by python. The subject was very foreign to me, and my friends recommended I switch majors to finance. However, after two and half year, I'm a lot comfortable with programing and web develop after taken CS100, COM421. 
		
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p class="styleText">After a couple of years as a CS student at IIT, I was finding an internship this summer. One company accepted me. However, my plan was disrupted due to my family coming. And I will prepare for GRE test instead.
		
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p class="styleText">In May of 2017, I'll be graduating from IIT with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I'm taking this class as an upper level humanity class, because this class can give me more experience with web development, this will be very helpful for future career. Also, I don't want take a writing class as a foreign student honestly.   
		
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p class="styleText">My immediate plan is to go work or have an internship after I graduate. I hope I could get some experience and consolidates CS knowledge before I go to graduate school.						</p>
