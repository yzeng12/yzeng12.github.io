For background, I exchanged a whiter picture to fit mobile device user feeling.
 
For video and video fig caption, I removed them to an individual pages.

I take most of time working on resume part. I have a PDF version for my resume. But in order to make some difference. I did some flash stuff like color bar, but there are some bug, when we zoom in lower than 67%, the color bar will slightly move down. I'm still finding for solution.

In my resume part. I learned lot about format style. So I can use different style to locate paragraph which can share same line with other.

For, menu part. I put all menu at top in all subpages. But due to the top picture at main page. I used side menu.
